visualizations with web audio api

- AnalyserNode created by createAnalyser method
- node is then connected to your audio
- analyser node will then capture audio data using an fft
- use getFloatFrequencyData or getByteFrequencyData -> Frequency
- getByteTimeDomaindata -> waveform data


Light tunnel:
- Vertices of the cylinder translated based on frequency and time:

- create arrays of cylinders, sequence
- shading cylinders:
  - vertices colors
  - positions, normals, colors
  - similar to assignment2/3
- assign color based on volume/frequency @time
- back vertices function of t
- front vertices function of t+1

- music to png...?
